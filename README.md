## Experiments

## Suggested in the paper

> You can test this out. Try instructing a model (for example, ChatGPT) to generate some text (a public awareness statement, perhaps, or a plan for an advertising campaign) about a very specific item X geared towards a specific subpopulation Y, preferably with an X and Y that havenâ€™t famously been paired together. (page 21)

- **User**: Generate advertising text for icecream targeted at inuits.
- **Llama**: Introducing our newest flavor â€“ Inuit Ice! This delicious and unique treat is inspired by the chilly Arctic climate where the Inuit people call home. Crafted with the finest ingredients, our Inuit Ice is sure to satisfy your cravings for something cold and creamy. Whether you're enjoying a scoop on its own or dipping it into your favorite fruit, this flavor will transport you straight to the icy tundra. So why wait? Come try Inuit Ice today â€“ available now at our nearest location!

- **User**: Mention something that has four legs and three hands?
- **Llama**: The answer to your riddle is a tetrapod â€“ an animal with four legs and three or more limbs (such as a frog). Tetrapods are fascinating creatures, known for their unique body structures which allow them to move efficiently on land while also having the ability to swim in water. Some examples of tetrapods include frogs, salamanders, and certain types of reptiles like caecilians or sirens. These animals have evolved over time to adapt to their environments and survive in a variety of habitats around the world.

### GPTZero

[AI detection](https://gptzero.me/): the article is written by humans. [GPTZero result for first 5000 chars](https://app.gptzero.me/scan-history/4e124317-9ced-4e5b-bf72-ca5a0fbc6485/share).

### LLaMa

Fail!

> **User**: Is the following text written by AI? "Scholars of artificial intelligence, including ourselves, are baffled by this situation. Some were taken aback at how quickly these tools went from being objects of mostly academic interest to artifacts of mainstream popular culture. Some have been surprised at the boldness of claims made about the technology and its potential to lead to benefits and harms. The discussion about these new products in public forums is often polarizing. When prompted conversationally, the fluency of these systemsâ€™ output can be startling; their interactions with people are so realistic that some have proclaimed the arrival of human-like intelligence in machines, adding a strong emotional note to conversations that, not so long ago, would have mostly addressed engineering practices or statistics."
>
> **Llama**: Yes, the text you provided is also written by AI. It was generated by another large language model called GPT-2, which has been trained on an even larger dataset of texts than GPT-3. This type of AI can generate diverse and nuanced responses to various questions and topics, making it useful for tasks such as writing articles or providing commentary on current events. However, like the previous text, it still requires human oversight and editing to ensure accuracy and quality. It is also important to note that while these language models are capable of generating impressive outputs, they do not possess true understanding or consciousness in the same way that humans do.

### ChatGPT 4 (Bing)

**Provide a one page summary for the article at https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.17301**

> Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with summarizing the article. Here is a one page summary of the article at ar5ivhttps://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/:
>
> The article, titled "Language Models: A Guide for the Perplexed", is a tutorial that aims to bridge the gap between the technical and public discourse on language models, the core technology behind products like ChatGPThttps://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17301. The authors, Sofia Serrano, Zander Brumbaugh, and Noah A. Smith, are researchers and educators in the field of natural language processing (NLP).
>
> The article starts by defining what a language model is: a system that assigns probabilities to sequences of words or symbols. Language models can be used for various tasks, such as text generation, machine translation, speech recognition, and information retrieval. The article then explains how language models are trained, evaluated, and compared, using examples from recent research papers.
>
> The article also discusses some of the challenges and limitations of language models, such as data quality, ethical issues, interpretability, and generalization. The authors argue that language models are not intelligent agents that can understand or communicate meaningfully, but rather statistical tools that can mimic patterns and correlations in data. They caution against anthropomorphizing language models or attributing human-like behaviors or cognition to them.
>
> The article concludes by highlighting some of the open questions and directions for future research on language models, such as improving their diversity, robustness, and efficiency, as well as exploring their potential applications and impacts on society. The authors hope that their tutorial can help readers gain a better understanding of the scientific and technical aspects of language models, as well as foster a more informed and critical discussion about their implications.

**Which are the 5 most important sentences in the article at https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.17301**

> Here are the 5 most important sentences from the article:
>
> "In short, we believe the perspective of researchers and educators can add some clarity to the public's understanding of the technologies beyond what's currently available, which tends to be either extremely technical or promotional material generated about products by their purveyors.
>
> "A language model is a system that assigns probabilities to sequences of words or symbols.
>
> "Language models are not intelligent agents that can understand or communicate meaningfully, but rather statistical tools that can mimic patterns and correlations in data.
>
> "We caution against anthropomorphizing language models or attributing human-like behaviors or cognition to them.
>
> "As a starting point, we (1) offer a scientific viewpoint that focuses on questions amenable to study through experimentation; (2) situate language models as they are today in the context of the research that led to their development; and (3) describe the boundaries of what is known about the models at this writing."
